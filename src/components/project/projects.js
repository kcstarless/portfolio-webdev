Although I've completed several projects before, none ever felt truly completeâ€”this project is my chance to build a fully featured, polished experience. Inspired by Canal Street Market by Zeor.nyc, I'm adopting a similar design aesthetic for QVM.
              
              I've chosen to build this on Ruby on Rails 8 with Turbo and Stimulus. Initially, I considered NEXT.js and React.js, but I felt that the project didn't require heavy state management or intensive user interactions. Instead, I opted for a simple, single-stack solution. Turbo and Stimulus offer just the right amount of JavaScript for smooth, responsive interactions, while Rails provides a solid backbone and of course, my goto SASS rounds out the stack.`,
